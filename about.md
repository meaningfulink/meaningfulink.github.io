I’m a young student from North of America, and this blog is where I write a few of my thoughts on the inside and outside world. By publishing the occasional essay and short story here, I hope to adjust the connotations of the unpleasant word Teenager, and in the process raise the mean meaning of all the world’s writing.

I am a [homschooled](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/homeschooling) [autodidact](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/autodidact), and I have no formal education. I am an exepert generalist, and have not yet narrowed my focus to one particular facet of the life; however, I have particular interest in writing, reading, web development, music, neuroscience, and the meaning of life. In the past I have had periods of obsessiion with astronomy, sailing, chemistry, and mathematics.
